<h2>Worlds & Websites</h2>
Below are a number of websites I maintain that act as records and world guides for various TTRPG campaigns I'm a part of. These update fairly regularly with new content.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://keltokel.neocities.org/" target="_blank"><img src="homebrew1.png"><br>
KELTOKEL</a></b><br>
<b>System:</b> Dungeons & Dragons 5E / <b>Status:</b> Ongoing<br>
<b>Party Composition:</b> Lore Bard, Echo Knight Fighter, Fathomless Warlock, Oathbreaker Paladin, Divine Soul Sorcerer (deceased), Wild Magic Barbarian (part-time)<br>
<b>Setting Summary:</b> The world of Geb stands on the precipice of change following the Gate War and a subsequent conflict known as the Spasm. Young, emerging nations are rising to prominence while ancient dynasties are forced to consider their roles in a new and tumultous world. Wholly homebrew world with its own races, nations, mythologies and higher powers (elves/dwarves etc don't exist at all here).<br>
<b>Campaign Synopsis:</b> <i>"To attempt to enumerate the wickedness of the Marchioness Sebastienne Goeth would be folly, for there is no sin upon the face of Geb nor under the gaze of Ranute which she has not partaken of with enthusiasm. Her cruelty is only matched by her elusiveness, but the Eye of the Moon watches her as it does all others. One day, she will be offered up, and on that day, she will die."</i>
<br><br>
Late in the year 6997, four individuals, each with their own motives for pursuing the Marchioness, receive anonymous letters with a train ticket enclosed. The letter instructs them to gather at Vlaytock and board the caravan departing on the 12th of Early Las, 6998. Here, they pursue the Marchioness and die the following day when a fight erupts and the train derails off the mountain track. They also survive this ordeal. With the Marchioness seemingly dead and gone, the four travel together and follow the trail of her destruction for answers to their questions. 
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://glade.neocities.org/" target="_blank"><img src="homebrew2.gif"><br>
GLADE</a></b><br>
<b>System:</b> Dungeons & Dragons 5E / <b>Status:</b> Ongoing<br>
<b>Party Composition:</b> Grave Cleric, Totem Barbarian, Evocation Wizard, Rune Knight Fighter, Armorer Artificer (part-time)<br>
<b>Setting Summary:</b> The world of Glade is small planet, comprised of vast expanses of ocean and three major continents. It is also exceptionally old. Life evolved naturally over the course of billions of years, aided by an abundance of magic pouring into the material world through souls and places of power. The source of this magic is Mobius, the realm on the other side where the Gods reside and the dead rest. Patchwork homebrew world comprised of core classic D&D races (e.g. elves/dwarves/orcs), D&D races that are not usually playable (e.g. satyrs, goblins) and custom races (e.g. primordians - elemental humanoids, infernals - superficially tieflings but not actually).<br>
<b>Campaign Synopsis:</b> Ten years prior to the events of the campaign, the world was thrown into lurch by a global phenomenon that came to be known as 'the ripple'. This event swept through the world, cutting off the foresight of the clairvoyants. It also radically altered the nature of magic in the world - practices that used to be commonplace such as communing with the Gods, healing the sick and speaking to the dead became near impossible for the average magic adept.
<br><br>
Three friends - an acolyte of the God of death, a wizard's apprentice and a traveling musician - normally enjoy a peaceful, uneventful life in the farming heartland of Feylin. After proving themselves capable, they are tasked with entering an unexplored temple deep in the Fae Glen and retrieving the valuables therein. Unfortunately, one of these valuables turns out to be a Shard of Creation - a rare object said to be created at the birth of the universe - and unearthing this object threatens to destabilize the world both politically and magically.
