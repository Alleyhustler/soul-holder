<div id="Summary" class="tabcontent">
<div class="block">
<div class="title">Story</div>
<div class="txt">
Orphaned as an infant and raised by human parents in Lion's Arch, Annachponae's sensibilities, mannerisms and dress appear distinctly non-asuran. His parents have never offered a straight answer about his odd name but it seems likely they misunderstood asuran naming conventions. He normally goes by 'Annach'. Despite his love for them, he does not use his family's surname.
<br><br>
On the cusp of adulthood Annach felt caught between worlds. Seeking a solution to quell this feeling, he developed a sudden interest in moving to Rata Sum and attempting to integrate with his own kind. He was accepted into the College of Synergetics despite his lack of foundational asuran education - the Councillors were interested in exploring avenues for practical applications of his shadow magic, but (rather bluntly) recognized Annach was unlikely to cope with the demands of higher education. He was quickly scouted by Professor Gorr who was both interested in Annach's magic for the Order of Whispers and because he "liked him".
<br><br>
Ultimately, Annach did not complete his degree and transitioned to work full-time for the Order of Whispers. It was during this time he developed a keen interest in firearms, particularly the matter of whether they could become an effective focus for his magic. Eventually he petitioned the Order for a solution to the Inquest presence in Rata Sum and was told the organization had a policy of non-interference in such matters. Frustrated, Annach withdrew his highly-classified research and cloaking tech prototypes, bringing them instead to an anti-Inquest resistance group comprised of concerned citizens and ex-members seeking escape and atonement. He fell in love with Rahal, an ex-Inquest asura and one of the most prominent members. He worked closely with her and the organization for approximately a year before she was revealed to be a double agent and ruthlessly decimated the organization - he escaped with his life, she escaped with his life's work.
<br><br>
In the present day Annach remains unaffiliated. He travels Tyria on the back of his mount, arriving at areas of Inquest activity based on the reports of his various informants.
</div>
</div>
<div class="block">
<div class="title">Personality</div>
<div class="txt">
The epitome of 'chaotic good', Annach is an intense individual who lives staunchly according to his values. More than anything, he is driven by his desire to affect positive change in the world by his own hand. In his youth this included assisting organizations such as the Order of Whispers, the Council of Lion's Arch and even the peacemakers. Years of continual disappointment with the corruption and ineffectiveness of such bodies have radicalized him, pushing his views to an extreme. To Annachponae, organizations such as the Inquest, White Mantle, Nightmare Court and others are a cancer to be cut out, undeserving of mercy and beyond reformation. Though he tolerates them, he quietly looks down on the apathetic and apolitical.
<br><br>
Beneath layers of bitterness and resentment lies a man who experiences his emotions deeply and is easily moved to tears. He enjoys singing and is roundly described as having a beautiful voice.
</div>
</div> 
<div class="block">
<div class="title">Appearance</div>
<div class="txt">
A male asura of slightly above-average height and weight. Strands of black hair with only the barest undertone of red fall around his face. The hair at the nape of his neck has never been cut, resulting in a long, thin ponytail. Cool grey eyes are framed by long, luxurious lashes. He normally has his face covered - this seems to be a habit picked up from his time working as a spy for the Order of Whispers. Under his clothes his hide is covered in striking black-and-white striped markings reminiscent of a zebra.

<img src="annafriend1.png" align="left" hspace="4"><a href="dinny.html"><b>Dinny:</b></a> Annachponae's oldest asuran friend, the two having met as children in Lion's Arch during a stopover as Dinny's family traveled from the Priory Monastery. His connection to her might have sparked the desire to live among other asura. He somewhat resents that she became a Peacemaker but appreciates that they share a hatred of the Inquest and that she's "bad at her job".
<br><br>
<img src="annafriend2.png" align="left" hspace="4"><b>Nrilla:</b> A troublemaker of an asura with similar abilities to his own. Lighthearted and free-spirited, he feels her jovial nature prevents him from falling too far off the deep end. She frequently demonstrates her affection through bullying and (sometimes rather dangerous) pranks. He enjoys her company and allows her to travel with him often.
<br><br>
<img src="annafriend3.png" align="left" hspace="4"><b>Miyppa:</b> A Statics student met through Dinny when he first moved to Rata Sum. He seemed to be interested in her, but he became engrossed in his work for the Order and the two have not been in contact for some time.
<br><br><br>
<img src="annafriend4.png" align="left" hspace="4"><b>Rahal (Ex):</b> Annachponae's traitorous former lover. A fast-talking, self-interested, charismatic woman with bright pink hair. In more recent times she has tampered with bloodstone and wears bloodstone-infused power armor. Even though their paths have crossed and he's more capable now, memories of their time together burn bright and Annachponae can't bring himself to kill her.

<div id="Trivia" class="tabcontent">
<div class="block">
<div class="title">Miscellaneous Facts</div>
<div class="txt">❤︎ Series/setting: Guild Wars 2<br>
❤︎ His biological father is the notorious pirate Long-Eared Lexx. He is unaware of his pirate heritage.<br>
❤︎ Annachponae's shadow magic is reactive and often responds to his emotions, particularly negative ones. Feelings of shame or despair will cause him to turn invisible against his will.<br>
❤︎ He assisted in the reconstruction of Lion's Arch but thinks "it looked better before".<br>
❤︎ His scarf/muffler is the same material as the cloth on Dinny's armor - it's a sentimental item.<br>
❤︎ Unusual sexual tastes, surprising his lovers - while he can (and often does) assume the dominant role in an intimate scenario, he is secretly a masochist and enjoys being restrained/disempowered.
