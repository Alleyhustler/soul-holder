<h2>MUSIC</h2>
<h3>Jukeboxes</h3>
Large, lengthy playlists with a consistent genre or mood. Will open in a new, themed page. Updated occassionally.
<br><br>
<b><a href="heatwave.html" target="_blank">HEATWAVE</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Vaporwave<br>
Handpicked personal selection of favorite dreamy, summery-sounding vaporwave compositions.
<br><br>
<b><a href="nightdrive.html" target="_blank">NIGHT DRIVE</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Future Funk / City Pop<br>
"Best of" future funk playlist full of fun, danceable bops.
<br><br>
<b><a href="zengarden.html" target="_blank">ZEN GARDEN</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Ambient<br>
Extremely relaxing playlist ideal for meditation and sleep. No vocals.
<h3>Mini Playlists</h3>
Short, tight playlists constructed around a particular theme or mood. These used to be hosted on 8tracks and SUAN.FM but YouTube's aggressive policies killed every single playlist/music aggregation platform. Playlists will open in either YouTube or Soundcloud and are liable to break any time.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/43501/sets/ooo" target="_blank">ooo</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Lo-fi, chillhop<br>
Dreamy, floaty lo-fi that evokes feelings of romance and bliss. 19 songs.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/43501/sets/xxx" target="_blank">xxx</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Lo-fi, Japanese hip-hop<br>
The spiritual successor and "b-side" to ooo. Mellow Japanese rap tracks interspersed with instrumental chill beats. 14 songs.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmSAI08PHevJwKhGo8-5RB7m" target="_blank">Scorching Saturn</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Acid jazz, psych rock<br>
The playlist accompaniment to <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/20400784" target="_blank">Scorching Saturn.</a> Late 60's - early 70's psychedelic rock and acid jazz, mostly instrumental with a focus on reverb guitar, sitar and keyboard, following the musical motifs established in the character's theme music.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmS4LOyED1YxJDpEhreNYAq5" target="_blank">Guzmania</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Trip-hop, downtempo<br>
The playlist accompaniment to <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/8784718" target="_blank">Guzmania.</a> Atmosphere album intended to represent a sort of heady, disoriented, intoxicated infatuation.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/lemonmaid/sets/committing-arson" target="_blank">Committing Arson</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Eurobeat<br>
An Osomatsu-san themed eurobeat album inspired by the frenetic energy of the season 1 cour 1 OP "Hanamaru Pippi wa Yoiko Dake" with a song picked to represent each sextuplet. Makes for a <i>really</i> good running playlist.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmTIoKM1ve9fNVG09-_4l1Sp" target="_blank">Avec Sans</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Jazz Noir<br>
A moody, melancholy album in tribute to Sans from UNDERTALE, reflecting the jazz motifs and instruments used in "It's Raining Somewhere Else" from the UNDERTALE soundtrack (or "Sans' Date" in the game data).
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmRU528khdCouRmYIRKZ41fs" target="_blank">Unexcogitable</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> New wave, synthpop<br>
Character album for my husband's mad scientist character who never saw the light of day, but who I still love and have very strong impressions and ideas about.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/lemonmaid/sets/shining-scales-fishy-tails" target="_blank">Shining Scales & Fishy Tails</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Deep house (and other)<br>
Character album for my sona (the mermaid character I use to represent myself online). An undeniably vain blend of indie dance and progressive/ambient house tracks. Well, at least one of these tracks was sent to me by a good friend with the comment "this song sounds like you".
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmS5DeG7q7cLO5QzuF3TTEHg" target="_blank">Seems You've Mistaken Me For Someone Who Cares.</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Indie, alternative rock<br>
Character album for Matsuno Ichimatsu from Osomatsu-san, largely constructed around the song "Dirtbag". Made to fulfill a request from Tumblr for a character playlist with a particular sound and including some bands that were popular at the time. Don't enjoy this genre very much, it was hard to make.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmS2JAAFTkAMgRISaZnbVs-x" target="_blank">Lavender</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Mixed electronic<br>
Character album for Matsuno Ichimatsu from Osomatsu-san. This was the first one I made and this one reflects my personal tastes and sensibilities (in contrast to the above). It was important to me to include songs with relevant lyrics but that weren't too edgy or mopey, and to have a clear musical progression from start to finish.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmRARSBKgDTYDMqXwsYxD8Ty" target="_blank">The Merchant</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Celtic<br>
Character playlist for Rhisiart Santee, a simple human merchant looked upon by the Goddess of nature. Celtic and similar folk music arranged in a chronology of his life, from childhood to leaving home, adventuring to meeting the woman who would become his wife.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmSDNBOsTg9d1NwLjcLRoNjY" target="_blank">Cabin for Two</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> VGM, Ambient<br>
A playlist request: "A peaceful, comfortable winter-time romance."
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmRd9RjHptibq3LZJf6lqCq5" target="_blank">Catface</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Uptempo, chiptune<br>
A playlist request: "Bright, colorful, sickeningly sweet bubblegum-y pop."
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmp--_w_PDmTVajFbwYcI7pHwB1hG7Iyr" target="_blank">Kee Heh Ha Mo-Atata</a></b><br>
<b>Genre:</b> Drone, world music<br>
A playlist request: "Mystical, exotic music for a fortune-teller type character."
