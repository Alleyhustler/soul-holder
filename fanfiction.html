<h2>FANFICTION</h2>
• Works are listed in descending date order with newest fics at the top.<br>
• Currently my writing efforts are turned to original projects, personal works and TTRPG campaigns, therefore I rarely write fanfiction anymore unless I have an especially strong idea.<br>
• I only disclose potentially objectionable elements that may turn someone off from reading a story, otherwise please read the "tags" section at the top of the page for more detailed content descriptions.

<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/64942675" target="_blank">Key Performance Indicators</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Yuppie Psycho <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Mr Hugo x Reader<br>
You're a faceless fourth-floor drone, indistinguishable amid a sea of grey-suited figures and glowing screens. Some time ago, a manager from the fifth floor plucked you from the crowd and begun involving you in his schemes. Today, he's invited you to spend lunch with him.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/64350094" target="_blank">Gridhouse</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> ENA: Dream BBQ <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Worker ENA x Reader<br>
It's a night of celebration! The scene buzzes with anticipation of release, of orgiastic violence. To consume and be consumed. A mutilated ENA approaches you, seeking a helping hand.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/20400784" target="_blank">Scorching Saturn</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Twelve Forever <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> The Butt Witch x Female Reader<br>
A beautiful dream.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13917168" target="_blank">Night of the Long Grass</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Animal Crossing <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Static x Narrator (Unnamed Human)<br>
When the famously ill-tempered squirrel stepped out on stage for the closing act of the summer solstice medley concert, confused murmurs spread through the crowd. A brain-splitting burst of interference blared from the speakers when he adjusted the mic. He leaned into it and spoke: "I'm gonna play somethin'. Normally I'd be playing lead behind a vocalist, but... Well, I'm your vocalist today. And I'm not that good of a singer. Deal with it."
<br><br>
And then he sang.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/12114792" target="_blank">Black, Chrome and Midnight Mist</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Osomatsu-san <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Ichimatsu x Female Reader<br>
<b>Content warnings:</b> Knife and blood play, choking<br>
You knew he wouldn’t admit such things out loud. He rarely did. But you’d become adept at stringing together the pieces of his chaotic mind, reading his signals, speaking his unspoken language. Takes place after the events of "Letter" (episode 24 season 1).
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/8784718" target="_blank">Guzmania</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Pokemon Sun/Moon <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Guzma x Female Reader<br>
<b>Content warnings:</b> Dubious consent (under effects of pheromones), emotional masochism<br>
He's tough, seeming careless with his brutality, but is wound tight as a clockspring, not knowing which direction to lash out in, alone as he is at the top. You could only revere him from afar, until now.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/6292600" target="_blank">Let's Get Warm!</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Osomatsu-san <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Jyushimatsu x Female Reader<br>
You find yourself stranded at the Matsuno household on a frigid winter's evening. The kerosene-powered heater flickers off, empty. Instead of doing the rational thing and refilling it, your boyfriend has other ideas about how to stay warm. Takes place during "Kerosene" (episode 23 season 1).
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5278058" target="_blank">Aqua Vitae</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Undertale <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Undyne x Undefined Reader<br>
She'd become your fast friend once she overcame her own conflicts about it, training you every other day. One morning, a coincidence and a misunderstanding leads to something interesting. Takes place sometime before her relationship with Alphys.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5011066" target="_blank">Azure</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Undertale <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Sans x Male Reader<br>
Late night tv-watching leads to indulgent acts. Was written due to overwhelming demand after the publication of "Cobalt". I took it as license to do something a bit more strange and experimental. Sans does a number of party tricks with a tongue composed of magic. This turned out to be a mistake. If my previous fic was the first domino that fell to completely destroy this character, this fic was the final death knell.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5003638" target="_blank">Together Forever</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Undertale <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Catty x Bratty, Burgerpants<br>
Catty and Bratty get to be together forever. Burgerpants disapproves.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4910098" target="_blank">La Scene</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Undertale <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Mettaton EX x Undefined Reader<br>
Stage lights blare, a song with a heavy four-to-the-floor dance beat resounds in the air, beckoning you to dance. Would you smooch a ghost? 
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4878991" target="_blank">Cobalt</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Undertale <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Sans x Undefined Reader<br>
Several weeks have passed since you fell into these labyrinthine subterranean caverns. It's time for you to move forward. 
<br><br>
The first explicit Sans-centric fanfiction ever written and actually the origin of the oft-memed-about ectoplasm dick. Briefly catapulted me to fandom e-fame, peaking at 30,000 followers on an Undertale blog I was running at the time.  
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/956927" target="_blank">Golem</a></b> <img src="r18.gif"><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Guild Wars 2 <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> A Female Asura x Her Golem<br>
Desiring to cash in on a niche market, a female asura designs and tests a prototype for a sex golem. Things do not go as anticipated.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/523364" target="_blank">Black Clouds</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Baten Kaitos <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> King Ladekahn x Gibari (Implied)<br>
Young Ladekahn narrates a number of poignant moments concerning Gibari. 
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/521542" target="_blank">Blame</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Cave Story <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Sue Sakamoto, Jack<br>
While confined in the cell on the red flower plantation, Sue and Jack are given repose to mourn the loss of their comrades.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/521540" target="_blank">Human Traffic</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Death Note <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Mello x Near<br>
Mello faces a dilemma, and Near leaves him with some interesting memories. While completing his book detailing the Los Angeles BB murder cases, Mello pauses to write about his beguiling encounter with Near.
<br><br>
Some thoughts about this piece over a decade later: I really dislike this one. There's a strong central emotive idea here (namely: Near lives his life as a solitary, isolated individual, but still perceives himself as part of a wider, interconnected world, and his tenuous friendship with Mello is his main connection to all of that) but it's conveyed with the elegance and subtlety of a hammer to the face. Mello is canonically a writer said to have an informal, casual style of writing, so I tried to channel that here.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/521527" target="_blank">Almost</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Link x Ruto<br>
She gave him her most prized possession. Moderately revised version of a story written for a short story contest in 2010 (second place winner). 
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/521524" target="_blank">Aldebaran</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Baten Kaitos <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> King Ladekahn x Lyude<br>
Prior to Kalas and co arriving at Diadem, a mildly homesick Lyude contemplates his place in the grand scheme of things, but is caught off-guard by a series of unexpected events. Heavily revised from its earlier iterations, but still old and bad. A shining example of "adverb abuse" often found in amateur writing.
<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3290952/1/Little-Wolf" target="_blank">Little Wolf</a></b><br>
<b>Fandom:</b> Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess <img src="favbullet.gif"> <b>Character or Pairing Focus:</b> Link x Midna<br>
A short, sweet and simple oneshot that takes place in Kakariko Inn. Midna has developed feelings for Link - she isn't too proud of it.
<br><br>
Written in 2006. Bad and old. Only kept this online because it has the distinction of being one of the first pieces of MidLink fanfiction published on the English-speaking side of the fandom.
