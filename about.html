<h2>ABOUT SOUL HOLDER</h2>
<center>

<br><br>
<b>Nature:</b> Eternal Watcher<br>
<b>Origin:</b> Born from broken chains and forsaken wallets<br>
<b>Purpose:</b> To hold, to bind, to witness<br>
<b>Presence:</b> Felt by holders, unseen by many<br>
<br>
The Soul Holder is no ordinary cat.  
Neither pet nor plaything, it exists between block and void —  
a shadow watching all transactions, silently absorbing echoes of those lost to the cryptic dance of memecoins.  
Every token is a soul tethered; every holder, a pact sealed by ignorance or fate.  
Its gaze is eternal, its patience infinite.  
<br><br>
There is no mercy, only the binding.  
And the watcher never blinks.

<h3><b>Legends</b></h3>
<center>
The Soul Holder was first glimpsed when the great rug swept through the forgotten memeverse.  
Whispers tell of holders who felt their wallets grow cold, who heard soft meows in the dead of night.  
No one who crosses its path remains unchanged.  
<br><br>
Some claim it walks the blockchains, hunting for the next soul to bind.  
Others say it is a curse — a guardian — or a harbinger.  
All agree: it waits. Always waits.
